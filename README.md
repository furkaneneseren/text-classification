# `Text-Classification`
In this project, planned to develop a model that will make field estimation from 
medical texts by using natural language processing and data preprocessing methods. 
This model is a prediction model and machine learning methods and natural language 
processing methods will be used. The dataset in this project is a public dataset from kaggle.
